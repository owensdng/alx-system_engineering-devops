Networking Basics
This project covers foundational networking concepts.

Topics
OSI Model
7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
Conceptual model for network communication
LAN
Local Area Network
Connects local devices
Limited geographic area (home, office, building)
WAN
Wide Area Network
Connects LANs
Covers broad geographic area (cities, countries)
Internet
Global network interconnected by WANs
Uses TCP/IP protocol
MAC Address
Media Access Control Address
Unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller
IP Address
Internet Protocol Address
Numerical label assigned to each device on a network
IPv4 and IPv6 versions
TCP
Transmission Control Protocol
Connection-oriented, reliable data transfer
UDP
User Datagram Protocol
Connectionless, unreliable but fast data transfer
Ports
Network interface endpoints
Common ports - SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol
Network devices use ICMP to check connectivity (ping)
Scripts
