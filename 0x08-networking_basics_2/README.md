## Project Tasks

### Task 0: Change My Home IP

In this task, I create a Bash script to modify the IP address resolution for localhost and facebook.com by editing the `/etc/hosts` file.

### Task 1: Show Attached IPs

For this task, I develop a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on my machine.
